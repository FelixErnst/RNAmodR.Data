# RNAmodR.RData

The package contains example data for RNAmodR package and other related 
packages. It probably makes sense to have a look at 
[RNAmodR](https://github.com/FelixErnst/RNAmodR) to check out how the data can 
be used.

# Installation

The current version of the RNAmodR.Data package is available from GitHub.

```
remotes::install_github("FelixErnst/RNAmodR.Data")
# the package does not be attached since it just contains data
```

A submission to Bioconductor is planned.
